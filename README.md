# Gas-DB
A drone that collects environmental data and feeds it into a publically accessible database.
The data is visualized in four different graphs with the topics of car exhaust fumes, temperature/humidity, UV radiation and gas concentration. The site is hosted via Python-Flask and uses a JSON file as a database.
This website with the corresponding web server was written during Jugendhackt 2023 by Marco, Jan, Yannik, Julian and Tobias.
